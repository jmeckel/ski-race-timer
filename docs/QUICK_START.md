# Ski Race Timer - Quick Start

**Get timing in under 2 minutes.**

Version 5.24.6

---

## Timer Operator

1. **Install the app** -- Open the URL in your browser. On iOS: Share > Add to Home Screen. On Android/Chrome: Menu > Install app.
2. **Complete onboarding** -- Choose your language, set a device name (e.g., "Start Gate"), select the Timer role, and optionally enable photo capture and cloud sync.
3. **Enter bib number** -- Tap the numbers on the radial dial to enter the racer's bib (e.g., tap 5 for bib 005).
4. **Select timing point and run** -- Tap **S** (Start) or **F** (Finish) on the left side of the dial center. Tap **L1** or **L2** on the right side for the run number.
5. **Record the time** -- Tap the large **Record Time** button at the moment the racer crosses. The GPS-synced timestamp is saved automatically.

## Gate Judge

1. **Select the Gate Judge role** -- During onboarding (or in Settings), choose Gate Judge as your device role.
2. **Assign your gates** -- Enter the gate range you are responsible for (e.g., gates 5-12) and select which run (L1/L2).
3. **Tap the gate** -- When you see a fault, tap the gate number in the grid. The fault detail panel opens below.
4. **Select fault type** -- Choose **MG** (missed gate), **STR** (straddled), or **BR** (broken). The bib of the current racer auto-fills.
5. **Save** -- Tap **Save Fault**. The gate and bib stay selected so you can quickly record successive faults.

## Chief Judge

1. **Enable cloud sync** -- In Settings, enter a Race ID and 4-digit PIN so all devices share the same data.
2. **Enter Chief Judge mode** -- From the Results tab, open the Chief Judge panel. You will be prompted to verify the PIN.
3. **Review faults** -- Browse faults submitted by gate judges. Approve or reject fault deletion requests.
4. **Set penalty mode** -- Choose **FLT** (time penalty per fault, for U8/U10 categories) or **DSQ** (disqualification) depending on race rules.
5. **Export results** -- From the Results tab, export to CSV in Race Horology format for official race processing.

## Multi-Device Setup

1. **Use the same Race ID** on every device (start timer, finish timer, gate judges).
2. **Use the same 4-digit PIN** on every device to authenticate cloud sync.
3. **Give each device a unique name** (e.g., "Start", "Finish", "Gate 5-12") so entries are identifiable.

All devices sync automatically every 5 seconds when connected.
